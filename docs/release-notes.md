## Release Notes

## 0.3 (July 15, 2020)

First release with third-party contributions! Vastly improved support for realistic NXOS data center deployments. Besides 32 closed bugs, main enhancements include:

* Improved EVPN assert to handle cases of using routed multicast underlay instead of ingress replication. This includes checking for consistency of multicast groups for a VNI across nodes.
* NXOS support for EVPN requires version 9.3.3 or later as there's no command to get certain info about all VNI, only by specific VNI values.
* Improved EVPN show and summarize to include more meaningful outputs.
* Improved BGP and OSPF assert. BGP assert especially handles a few more cases such as when peering is not over directly connected interfaces. 
* **ALPHA feature** Support for topology as a first class resource. Try topology show and topology summarize. This is still work in progress.
* Support for the poller to gather data from nodes and saving them to a directory. You can then run the poller to read this directory to build the output files.

## 0.2.1 (June 18, 2020)

The main issue was fixing a bug in Junos BGP data capture that got missed in the tests. This is issue #170. We also fixed #169 listed below as part of release 0.2. However, another Junos bug is still open

* [Bug #176](https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq/issues/176): BGP uptime is not properly captured for Junos.

## 0.2 (June 18, 2020)

The **main features** of this release are **IPv6 support** and support for **extracting data out of NXOS and Junos** devices. A few bugs have been fixed. **The parquet data format has changed and will change for one more release before we start supporting an evolving schema format.** If you have significant or important data saved with the older release, please reach out to us for specific assistance.

More specific release notes and caveats emptor are:

* Not all asserts work with Junos devices because of the LLDP information provided as a result of the default configuration. 
* No testing has been done at scale. Please reach out to us if you're running into problems with polling either a large number of devices or pulling a lot of data (routes, macs, arp/nd usually) from a single device. If you don't run into any problems doing so, please reach out to us to let us know about your success.

* [Bug #169](https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq/issues/169) which shows an incorrect error message in the poller log file
